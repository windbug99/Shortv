# Deployment Guide

## Deployment Issues Fixed

The following deployment issues have been resolved:

### 1. Build Script Configuration
- **Problem**: The original `npm run build` command was using incorrect esbuild parameters (`--outdir=dist` instead of `--outfile=dist/index.js`)
- **Solution**: Created `production-build.js` script that correctly builds the server bundle

### 2. Missing dist/index.js File
- **Problem**: The build process wasn't creating the required `dist/index.js` file
- **Solution**: Updated build script to use `--outfile=dist/index.js` parameter and added verification

### 3. Production Dependencies
- **Problem**: Missing production package.json in dist directory
- **Solution**: Build script now creates production package.json with only runtime dependencies

### 4. Shared Modules
- **Problem**: Shared modules weren't being copied to dist directory
- **Solution**: Build script copies shared modules and client files to dist directory

## Build Scripts Available

### `production-build.js`
- Main production build script
- Creates `dist/index.js` server bundle
- Copies all required files for production
- Includes verification steps

### `deploy.js`
- Complete deployment wrapper
- Checks for required files
- Installs dependencies if needed
- Runs production build
- Performs final verification

### `build.js`
- Standard build script (updated)
- Works with existing npm build command
- Includes frontend and backend builds

## Manual Deployment Steps

1. **Run the production build**:
   ```bash
   node production-build.js
   ```

2. **Verify the build output**:
   - Check that `dist/index.js` exists
   - Check that `dist/package.json` exists
   - Check that `dist/shared/` directory exists

3. **Test production server**:
   ```bash
   cd dist
   NODE_ENV=production node index.js
   ```

## Replit Deployment

The deployment should now work correctly with Replit's automatic deployment process. The build command in `.replit` will use `npm run build`, which has been fixed to work properly.

## Troubleshooting

If deployment still fails:

1. **Check build output**: Ensure `dist/index.js` is created
2. **Verify dependencies**: Check that esbuild is available
3. **Check file permissions**: Ensure build scripts are executable
4. **Review logs**: Check deployment logs for specific error messages
